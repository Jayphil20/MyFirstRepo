Brief Introduction About Myself
I'm Jayda, a passionate, evolving young woman on a mission to build a life that’s both meaningful and authentic. I'm currently in university, focused on finishing strong, while actively exploring what it means to live with purpose, faith, and clarity. I value growth—whether it’s through learning new skills like French and guitar, managing my finances with intention, or nurturing the quiet parts of my spiritual journey. I’m not afraid to start over, ask tough questions, or admit when I need help, because I know my strength lies in honesty and resilience.

In everything I do, I’m guided by a desire to live fully and intentionally. Whether it’s planning for my Master’s in Manitoba, working toward financial independence, or simply showing up for myself daily, I’m learning to trust God more and fear less. This season of my life is about rising, rebuilding, and remembering that I’m allowed to grow at my own pace—and still reach everything I dream of.
